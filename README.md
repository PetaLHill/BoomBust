# R code for Hill et al. 2023

## Fragmentation and gene flow in a boom-bust metapopulation reveal a trade-off between heterozygosity and allelic richness.

The accompanying code allows you to rerun the simulations as described in the Manuscript of Hill et al. (2023). To fully reproduce the results and figures the code runs (>24 hours on a machine with many processors >16). Therefore we included a "toy" example, which demonstrates the code and produces figures for the subset of the runs. It is possible though, to define the parameter space exactly as in the manuscript by un/commenting a couple of lines, so it is possible to reproduce the simulation and outcomes exactly mimicing the parameter set as in the manuscript, an moreover it is straightforward to extend the parameters space to additional combinations if requested.

Please note the simulation is only tested for the stated versions of the R packages and programs and if the reader tries to run it, it may break due to incompatibilities of packages, therefore we recommend an installation that uses the same versions of packages and software programs (Slim and plink).
