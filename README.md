# The accompanying code allows you to rerun the simulations as described in the Manuscript of Hill et al. (2023): Fragmentation and gene flow in a boom-bust metapopulation reveal a trade-off between heterozygosity and allelic richness on a toy example.

# As the actual simulation and analysis takes some time to run (about 2 days using 40 cores) we provide means to run the simulation with fewer parameter combinations. 

# Please note the simulation is only tested for the stated versions of the R packages and programs and if the reader tries to run it, it may break due to incompatibilities of packages
